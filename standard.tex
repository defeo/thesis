We have seen in Chapter~\ref{chap:lattice} two independant methods to create
lattices of compatibly embedded finite fields. In this Chapter, we present a new
framework, inspired by both Conway polynomials and Bosma-Canon-Steel, that we
call \emph{standard lattice of compatibly embedded finite fields}.

The two methods of Chapter~\ref{chap:lattice} both have their drawbacks: Conway
polynomials are expensive to compute and thus need to be precomputed, making
thme inefficient for large extensions, while Bosma-Canon-Steel needs more
computation each time an embedding is added in the lattice.
