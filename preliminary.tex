Throughout all this document, we will use a lot of results from algebra. This
chapter is here to sum up these results and try to maintain the illusion that
this thesis is self-contained. The reader familiar with the notions of finite
fields, algebraric function fields, complexity model may very well skip this
chapter.

\section{Finite fields}
Finite fields are ubiquitous in cryptography and coding theory, probably because
their field structure, a rigid one, allows to understand how they work, and
their finiteness makes them easier to represent on a computer. They are also
everywhere in this thesis, and are probably on almost every paper I
wrote on during these last three years. They are quite important.

\section{Algebraic function fields}
\section{Complexity model}
We use \cite{GG13}.
