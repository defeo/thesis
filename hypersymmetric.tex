In Chapter~\ref{chap:bilinear}, we have seen the notions of bilinear complexity
and symmetric bilinear complexity. We now investigate even stronger
notions of symmetry, allowing to have very short representations of a bilinear
map.

% Comment about the trisymmetric formulas, it is true that F_4/F_2 can be
% represented by a trisymmetric formula but it is not the case for F_8/F_2. We

Let $\K$ be a finite field, $V_1$, $V_2$ and $W$ three finite-dimensional $\K$-vector
space and
\[
  \Phi:V_1\times V_2\to W
\]
a bilinear map. Recall Definition~\ref{defi:bilinear-formula}:
\[
  \Phi(x, y) = \sum_{j=1}^t\varphi_j(x)\psi_j(y)w_j,
\]
where for all $1\leq j\leq t$, $\varphi_j\in V_1^\vee$ and $\phi_j\in V_2^\vee$ are linear forms and
$w_j\in W$ is a vector, is called a \emph{bilinear formula} of length $t$. If
the spaces $V_1$ and $V_2$ are equal and if the bilinear map $\Phi$ is
symmetric, \ie if for all $x, y\in V$
\[
  \Phi(x, y) = \Phi(y, x),
\]
we can investigate the existence of formulas satisfying the same condition of
symmetry, \ie formulas where for all $1\leq j\leq t$, $\varphi_j=\psi_j$,
resulting in \emph{symmetric} bilinear form:
\[
  \Phi(x, y) = \sum_{j=1}^t\varphi_j(x)\varphi_j(y)w_j.
\]
In fact, we can define other interesting types of symmetries, but it is useful
to first generalize the notions that we saw in Chapter~\ref{chap:bilinear} to
higher dimensions.
\subsection{Generalization to multilinear maps}
The definitions of bilinear formula and bilinear complexity are not bound to the
bilinear case and can be generalized to arbitrary dimension. These general
definitions will be used in Section~\ref{subsec:trisym} to define
\emph{hypersymmetric} complexity.
\begin{defi}[Multilinear formula]
Let $V_1, V_2, \dots, V_s$ and $W$ be $s+1$ finite-dimensional $\K$-vector
spaces and
\[
  \Phi:V_1\times V_2\times\dots\times V_s\to W
\]
an $s$-multilinear map. A \emph{multilinear formula}, or \emph{multilinear
decomposition}, or \emph{multilinear algorithm} of length $t$ for $\Phi$ is a
collection of $s\times t$ linear forms $\varphi_1^{(1)}, \varphi_2^{(1)}, \dots,
\varphi_t^{(1)}\in V_1^\vee$ up to $\varphi_1^{(s)}, \varphi_2^{(s)}, \dots,
\varphi_t^{(s)}\in V_s^{\vee}$ and $t$ vectors $w_1, \dots, w_t$, such that for all $x_1\in V_1, \dots, x_s\in
V_s$, we have
\[
  \Phi(x_1, \dots, x_s) =
  \sum_{j=1}^t\varphi_j^{(1)}(x_1)\dots\varphi_j^{(s)}(x_s)w_j.
\]
\end{defi}
\begin{defi}[Multilinear complexity]
Let $V_1, V_2, \dots, V_s$ and $W$ be $s+1$ finite-dimensional $\K$-vector
spaces and
\[
  \Phi:V_1\times V_2\times\dots\times V_s\to W
\]
an $s$-multilinear map. The \emph{multilinear complexity} $\mu(\Phi)$ of $\Phi$ is the
minimal length $t$ of a multilinear formula for $\Phi$.
\end{defi}
As in the case of bilinear complexity, the multilinear complexity $\mu(\Phi)$ of a
multilinear map $\Phi$ can also be defined as the rank of the tensor in 
\[
  V_1^\vee\otimes\dots\otimes V_s^\vee\otimes W
\]
corresponding to $\Phi$, see Example~\ref{ex:bilinear-complexity} for an
illustration of this correspondence in the bilinear case. In the case where
\[
  V_1 = V_2 = \dots = V_s,
\]
symmetric formulas and
symmetric complexity can also be generalized when $\Phi$ is a \emph{symmetric}
multilinear map, \ie when for all permutation $\sigma\in\mathfrak S_s$ and for
all vectors $x_1, \dots, x_s\in V$, we have
\[
  \Phi(x_1, \dots, x_s) = \Phi(\sigma(x_1), \dots, \sigma(x_s)).
\]
\begin{defi}[Symmetric multilinear formula]
Let $V$ and $W$ be two finite-dimensional $\K$-vector
spaces and
\[
  \Phi:\underset{\textrm{$s$ times}}{\underbrace{V\times\dots\times V}}\to W
\]
a symmetric $s$-multilinear map. A \emph{symmetric multilinear formula}, or
\emph{symmetric multilinear
decomposition}, or \emph{symmetric multilinear algorithm} of length $t$ for $\Phi$ is a
collection of $t$ linear forms $\varphi_1, \varphi_2, \dots,
\varphi_t\in V^\vee$ and $t$ vectors $w_1, \dots, w_t$, such that for all $x_1, \dots, x_s\in
V$, we have
\[
  \Phi(x_1, \dots, x_s) =
  \sum_{j=1}^t\varphi_j(x_1)\dots\varphi_j(x_s)w_j.
\]
\end{defi}
\begin{defi}[Symmetric multilinear complexity]
Let $V$ and $W$ be two finite-dimensional $\K$-vector
spaces and
\[
  \Phi:\underset{\textrm{$s$ times}}{\underbrace{V\times\dots\times V}}\to W
\]
a symmetric $s$-multilinear map. The \emph{symmetric multilinear complexity} $\musym(\Phi)$ of $\Phi$ is the
minimal length $t$ of a symmetric multilinear formula for $\Phi$. If no such
formula exists, we set
\[
  \musym(\Phi) = \infty.
\]
\end{defi}
Contrary to the bilinear case, some symmetric multilinear maps do not admit a symmetric
decomposition, but the problem of whether a symmetric multilinear map admits
a symmetric multilinear formula is well understood and follows from
Theorem~\ref{thm:symmetric-formula}.
\begin{thm}[{\cite[Thm.~A.7]{Randriam15}}]\label{th:criterion}
\label{thm:symmetric-formula}
Let $\Phi:V^s\to W$ be a $s$-multilinear map between finite dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb{F}_q$.
Then $\Phi$ admits a symmetric decomposition if and only if $\Phi$ is \emph{Frobenius-symmetric},
\ie if and only if it is symmetric and one of the following two conditions holds:
\begin{itemize}
\item $s\leq q$
\item $s\geq q+1$ and for all $u,v,z_1,\dots,z_{s-q-1}$ in $V$,
\[
\Phi(\underset{\textrm{$q$ times}}{\underbrace{u,\dots,u}},v,z_1,\dots,z_{s-q-1})=\Phi(u,\underset{\textrm{$q$ times}}{\underbrace{v,\dots,v}},z_1,\dots,z_{s-q-1}).
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\subsection{Trisymmetric and hypersymmetric complexity}
\label{subsec:trisym}

Under even stricter conditions, we can study the existence of even more
symmetric formulas. These formulas allow to describe a multilinear map with
fewer elements, and thus give a compact definition of the map. Since the
symmetry conditions are stonger there are fewer such formulas, and as a
consequence the search space is smaller. Thus, we expect algorithms to be
faster, as was the case when using Barbulescu \etal algorithm
(Algorithm~\ref{algo:BDEZ}) to find symmetric formulas. Let us define those
``stricter conditions''. Let
\[
  \Phi:V^s\to V
\]
be an $s$-multilinear symmetric map, \ie we additionnaly ask that $W=V$. We also
assume that $V$ has a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, that we write as a
scalar product
\[
 \begin{array}{ccc}
 V\times V &\to&\K\\
 (v,w)&\mapsto&\ps{v}{w}.
 \end{array}
\]
In that case, we know that the vector space $V$ is isomorphic to its dual space
$V^\vee$:
\[
  V\cong V^\vee,
\]
\ie for each linear form $\varphi\in V^\vee$, there exist a unique vector $a\in
V$ such that for all $x\in V$, we have
\[
  \varphi(x) = \ps{a}{x}.
\]
Under these conditions, we can now write a symmetric formula for $\Phi$ as
\[
  \Phi(x, y) = \sum_{j=1}^t\ps{a_i}{x}\ps{a_i}{y}w_j
\]
where for all $1\leq j\leq t$, $a_j\in V$ is a vector of $V$. As a consequence,
we can also describe a symmetric formula for $\Phi$ as the data of vectors
$(a_j)_{1\leq j\leq t}$ and $(w_j)_{1\leq j\leq t}$. In order to have an even
more compact description of $\Phi$, one can ask for the vectors $w_j$ to be
proportional to $a_i$, leading to the definition of hypersymmetric
formula.
\begin{defi}[Hypersymmetric formula]
Let $V$ a finite-dimensional $\K$-vector
spaces equipped with a saclar product and
\[
  \Phi:\underset{\textrm{$s$ times}}{\underbrace{V\times\dots\times V}}\to W
\]
a symmetric $s$-multilinear map. A \emph{hypersymmetric formula}, or
\emph{hypersymmetric decomposition}, or \emph{hypersymmetric algorithm} of length $t$ for $\Phi$ is a
collection of $t$ vectors $a_1, \dots, a_t\in V$ and $t$ scalars $\lambda_1,
\dots, \lambda_t\in\K$, such that for all $x_1, \dots, x_s\in
V$, we have
\[
  \Phi(x_1, \dots, x_s) =
  \sum_{j=1}^t\lambda_j\ps{a_j}{x_1}\dots\ps{a_j}{x_s}a_j.
\]
\end{defi}
\begin{defi}[Hypersymmetric complexity]
Let $V$ a finite-dimensional $\K$-vector spaces equipped with a saclar product
and
\[
  \Phi:\underset{\textrm{$s$ times}}{\underbrace{V\times\dots\times V}}\to W
\]
a symmetric $s$-multilinear map. The \emph{hypersymmetric complexity} $\muhyp(\Phi)$ of $\Phi$ is the
minimal length $t$ of a hypersymmetric formula for $\Phi$. If no such
formula exists, we set
\[
  \muhyp(\Phi) = \infty.
\]
\end{defi}
